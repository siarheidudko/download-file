This is the file jumping function for nodejs.
The original module is available in npm (by montanaflynn): https://www.npmjs.com/package/download-file

Regarding the original module, the bug was fixed:
When the file was jumped, only the read stream from http was controlled. Because of this, when the function was completed, the file size could be 0 bytes. I control the write stream to a file and, at the moment of its completion, check the existence and size of the file.

Modified: I check the header content-length, if it is specified, then I check that the file size is equal to the sum of bytes in the header. If the amount does not converge shoot an exceptional situation.

Minor code improvements.
